        <h1>How to Get the Testing &amp; Evaluation Right.</h1>
        <p>From here on in it's just administration - ticking all the boxes and justifying your choices. Making sure everything works and that you're happy with it. Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar are checked. Finally, evaluate what you did.</p> 
      </div>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Complete Your Test Plan.
            <span class="text-muted">Make doubly, triply sure that everything worked.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Way back in the design stage you put together a test plan and some success criteria. Now it's time to make sure that you've actually achieved it.</p>
          <p>Use the table that you designed at the design stage, and make sure you have evidence that all testing was actually completed. A screenshot should be enough to prove it. If there was any issues, these should have been resolved in the previous section - so re-run the test and take another screenshot to prove it now works. Evaluate whether everything meets the success criteria. If anything doesn't, explain why. If it does, show why.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">SPaG and Word balls.
            <span class="text-muted">How's your writing?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Take the time now to read back through your work and check the words you're using. Have you run a spell check? When you read it out loud to yourself, does it make any sense? Have you used the word 'iteration' where you meant to use 'function' or 'control'? Double and triple check it!</p>
          <p>Your target audience here is fairly professional, and as such you need to ensure that the language you use is appropriate. When you are justifying your work, use persuasive language. When you are talking technical, don't shy away from jargon. Finally, steer clear of colloquialisms - they don't mark for street cred!</p>

            <span class="text-muted">Take the time to make it look nice.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">This may seem unimportant next to the code, but if we can't decipher where your code actually is, it could cost you marks. Make sure that any images you have labelled are correctly labelled. Ensure flowcharts actually flow correctly. If something needs to be emphasised, <strong>emphasise it</strong>.</p>
          <p>Don't just throw it all together and think 'oh, it'll be fine'. Instead, correctly label each section. Use colour to distinguish between correct and incorrect results if it helps. Show your code in the same way as an IDE would - with colours to denote functions, variables, strings, data type values etc. Finally, actually copy the code into the word processor - not just a screenshot. If your code isn't there, it will take a long time to type everything in (and we might type it incorrectly), which could cause some major problems! Include the solution as a whole (i.e. the code files) if it helps!</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Evaluate.
            <span class="text-muted">How did it go?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Finally, we're here - the end of the road. How was it? Did you enjoy the system? Do you feel that the progress you made in this task was alright? What did you really struggle with (but now feel that you shouldn't have?) What would you do differently if you could do it all over again?</p>
          <p>This isn't just for marks. People who really want to become great within their profession or career are constantly evaluating their performances - whether on the athletics track, or in this case, in your coding environment. Knowing why things went wrong can set you up to kick any bad habits and gives us an idea of where you made progression. If you didn't get a working solution, this is where you can sell your reason. Running out of time isn't enough, there is usually an underlying reason why a task might not be completed. What might it be?</p>
