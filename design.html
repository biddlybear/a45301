        <p>The introduction might not be the most fun or interesting part of this coursework, but it's extremely important and affects your overall grade.</p>

            <span class="text-muted">Give us some background.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Your introduction is your way of showing to your teacher that you are approaching the task correctly. You should let us know what the task is asking you to create, and how you will go about it from design, to implementation, to evaluation.</p> 
          <p>Once you have analysed the requirements and <strong>justified</strong> how you will approach a solution (i.e. given us reasons why you've chosen to do it in the way that you have), it's time to move on to the algorithms.</p>

            <span class="text-muted">Show us how your code will work.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">A flowchart is your way of showing us that you understand how the data will move around the program that you are creating. Get this right and the rest should follow. Remember: your flowchart and final program should be fairly similar.</p>
          <p>If you're getting a bit stuck trying to figure out just what boxes should go where, and what a finished flowchart might look like, have a look at the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/design/electronics/logicrev7.shtml">GCSE Bitesize Logic page</a>. Everything you'll need to include has the basics in here. A fairly simple online tool that has free accounts in education to create your flowchart is <a href="http://www.lucidchart.com">Lucidchart</a>, which is fairly intuitive to use.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Pseudocode.
            <span class="text-muted">Introduce the logic behind your program.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Pseudocode is basically writing your program in something that looks a bit like code, but is in normal English. There are no hard and fast rules for pseudocode, so just try to make sure that everything feels like code. For examples, <a href="http://www.unf.edu/~broggio/cop2221/2221pseu.htm">click here</a>.</p>
          <p>Just make sure that your pseudocode logic is fairly similar to that of your flowchart. At this point you should be starting to think about how the code might be structured, including loops, subroutines (also called functions), and program control. Take your time here to get the logic right, and your code should almost syntax itself.

            <span class="text-muted">Specify your Variables.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">A data dictionary is like a normal dictionary, but for your variables. It tells you the name of the variable, the type, and what it will be used for. You could also include a bit of validation in the dictionary if you feel so inclined (for example, if you want it to be a number between two values), or tell us how big it might be.</p>
          <p>Data dictionaries work really well as tables, but can get complicated very quickly if you don't watch out! For an example of how a data dictionary could possibly look, <a href="http://www.teach-ict.com/as_a2_ict_new/ocr/AS_G061/315_database_concepts/data_dictionary/miniweb/pg3.htm">click here</a></p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Test Plan Strategy.
            <span class="text-muted">How will you test that it works?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">When you've finished coding your program, what are you going to test? Are you going to test for potential outcomes? Or erroneous inputs? Or both?</p>
          <p>When thinking about a test strategy, you'll want the following columns in a table for definite:
            <ul>
              <li>Test description - a couple of words or a sentence telling us what you're testing in this test</li>
              <li>Expected outcome - what are you expecting the result to be?</li>
              <li>Actual outcome - what was the actual result? Take a screenshot if you can!</li>
              <li>Test Passed - A simple Y or N</li>
              <li>Proposed Solutions - If it failed, why? What will you change?</li>
            </ul>
           If there is the chance that a test could fail a different time (e.g. if you are using random characters, or a user input error provides different outputs), then you might even want to provide more than one test.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Validation.
            <span class="text-muted">How are you going to ensure that your user doesn't do anything wrong?</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">Users aren't perfect - sometimes they'll press the wrong button, or do something that you don't want them too. Others are also malicious, and might try to not just break your program, but do much worse.</p>
          <p>Validation is something you can do to just make sure that the user is doing what you're expecting them to do. A list of validation checks can either be put into the data dictionary, or you could create a separate table if there are a large number of validation checks on some of your variables. If there are, make sure you reference it in your data dictionary.</p>
