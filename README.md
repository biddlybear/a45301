Help for OCR Controlled Assessment A453/01
======

Hi, thank you for taking a look at this little site that I've put together. I had originally just put this together for my own Computing class, but I figured that this might be useful for everyone.

If you want to use this resource in your classroom, you are free to copy, edit and otherwise use the details within any way that you want. Please also feel free to add it to your school's Intranet to save on data costs if that helps.

However, I do request that you keep the footer intact, and if you could just pop over to my twitter (https://twitter.com/biddly_bear) and mention how you're going to be using the resource in your school or as something to build upon, I'd really appreciate it.

If you'd like to fork, make changes, add other tasks etc. then feel free, but please continue to use the same rough style (i.e. Bootstrap) that I've used so far to keep everything together.

I hope that this might prove useful to both Teachers and Students, and wish you all the best in your teaching.
